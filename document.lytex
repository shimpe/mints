After reading Olivier Messiaen's book "The technique of my Musical Language" I started wondering
how exactly his "modes of limited transposition" create the sound they create. Major questions for me 
became: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What is so special about the property of \emph{limited transposition} that makes the music derived from it work so well?
\item Is music derived from a random subset of a chromatic scale on some sense "crippled" compared to music written based on 
Messiaen's modes? Can we find some kind of intuitive explanation why Messiaen's modes work well, arguably better than other non-diatonic modes? 
Can we use this insight to propose other modes that perhaps do not have limited transposition, but still might result in an interesting, fresh, sound?
\end{itemize}
I set out to do a series of experiments and came up with some insights that I intend to explain here. 
I apologize in advance if what I'm about to describe is already well-known and obvious to more informed readers.
Please accept that I'm writing this down only to further my own understanding of the matter. 
I do not claim to have found something new.

\section{Symmetry? What symmetry?}
Messiaen himself explains how his modes can be thought of as consisting of \emph{symmetrical} groups of notes. 
The exact nature of this symmetry was not entirely clear to me. In fact, at first sight it seemed more like repeating patterns than symmetry, 
and this is what I wanted to clarify.

As a starting point I set out to systematically enumerate all modes derived from a chromatic scale that have intervals symmetrically distributed 
around the f\# (the middle note of the chromatic scale starting on c). Note that during the experiments I don't directly take into account any 
property of \emph{limited transposition} but I will find back many of Messiaen's modes by considering only symmetry arguments anyway.

\subsection{Systematic enumeration}
The first thing to explain is how the modes with intervals symmetrically distributed around f\# can be systematically enumerated.

I started from a chromatic scale. On that scale I added symbols under each note. Note how the symbols that occur left of f\# return
later on to the right of f\#. This is important to keep symmetry of the intervals around f\#, as will hopefully become clearer in the next step.
For now, remember that the symbols under the complete chromatic scale form a \emph{palindrome}, i.e. if you read them left-to-right you get 
exactly the same sequence of symbols as when you read them right-to-left.

\begin{lilypond}
\relative c' {
  \cadenzaOn c4 cis d dis e f fis g gis a ais b c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
}
\addlyrics {
    p q r s t u v u t s r q p
  }
\end{lilypond}

In what follows we will now construct modes by assigning values 0 or 1 to each of the symbols p,q,r,s,t,u,v. A value of 0 indicates that the note to which 
the symbol is attached is not to be selected from the chromatic scale while constructing a mode. A value of 1 indicates that the notes to which the symbol 
is attached are to be selected from the chromatic scale. 

E.g. if we set p=1, q=1, r=1, s=1, t=1, u=1, v=1 we retain all the 
notes from the chromatic scale and end up with the chromatic scale itself. 
We can say that the chromatic scale is characterized by a "key" (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,1,1,1,1,1,1).
If we set p=1, q=0, r=1, s=0, t=0, u=0, v=1, we end up with a mode that contains the notes c, d, f\#, a\#, c'. This mode is characterized
by a key (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,0,1,0,0,0,1).

\begin{lilypond}
\score { 
   \new Staff = "up" {
      \relative c' {
	\cadenzaOn c4 cis d dis e f fis g gis a ais b c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
	\cadenzaOn c,4 \hideNotes cis\unHideNotes d \hideNotes dis e f\unHideNotes fis \hideNotes g gis a\unHideNotes ais \hideNotes b\unHideNotes c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
      }
      
      \addlyrics {
	  "p=1" "q=1" "r=1" "s=1" "t=1" "u=1" "v=1" "u=1" "t=1" "s=1" "r=1" "q=1" "p=1"
	  "p=1" "q=0" "r=1" "s=0" "t=0" "u=0" "v=1" "u=0" "t=0" "s=0" "r=1" "q=0" "p=1"
      }
    }
   \layout {
     \context { 
         \Staff 
         \remove Time_signature_engraver 
	 \accidentalStyle "forget"
      } 
   }
}
\end{lilypond}


This method for constructing modes has some properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Any combination of values 0,1 assigned to all of p, q, r, s, t, u, v results in a mode derived from the chromatic scale with intervals distributed symmetrically around f\#.
\item A different combination of values 0,1 assigned to p, q, r, s, t, u, v results in a different mode. In other words, there are no two different keys (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) that result in the same set of notes selected from the chromatic scale.
\item If we look at all possible ways that we can assign 0, 1 to p, q, r, s, t, u, v, we construct all possible subsets of the chromatic scale with intervals distributed symmetrically around f\#. In other words, we don't skip any modes symmetrical around f\# by using this method.
\item All in all, this means that any (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) key uniquely defines one mode with intervals symmetrically distributed around f\#.
\item There are $2^7=127$ different ways to assign the values 0, 1 to the variables p, q, r, s, t, u, v. This means that there are 127 unique modes with symmetrical distribution of intervals around f\#.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intermezzo: binary numbers}
In computer science a key like (0,1,1,0,0,1,0) can be interpreted as a binary number. Each number 1 or 0 is called a "bit".
For every binary number, there's an equivalent decimal number and vice versa.
In the systematic enumeration of modes in the appendices of this explanation, I use decimal equivalents of binary numbers,
because they take much less typesetting space. If you want to make sense of the explanations that follow, it's useful to understand how
binary numbers relate to decimal numbers, as explained now:

\subsubsection{Conversion from binary number to decimal number}\label{sec:bin2dec}
In order to convert from a binary number to a decimal number, one writes powers of two underneath the binary number and then 
multiplies and adds the results. As an example, consider conversion of number (0,1,1,0,0,1,0) to decimal:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllllllll}
0              & 1  & 1  & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & $\leftarrow$ write binary digits & \\     
64             & 32 & 16 & 8 & 4 & 2 & 1 & $\leftarrow$ write powers of 2 & \\
$*\downarrow$  & $*\downarrow$   & $*\downarrow$   & $*\downarrow$   & $*\downarrow$   & $*\downarrow$   & $*\downarrow$   & $\downarrow$ multiply one by one& \\
0              & 32 & 16 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & $\rightarrow$ sum to get: & $32+16+2=50$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that if I add extra 0's to the left of a binary number, its value doesn't change.
The same is true for a decimal number: if you write 6 or you write 06 you really have the same number.

\subsubsection{Conversion from a decimal number to a binary number}
In order to convert a decimal number back to a binary number one keeps on dividing the number by 2, 
and notes down the rest after division. As an example, consider converting 50 back to binary representation:

\begin{itemize}
\item We start from 50
\item divide 50 by 2 to get 25, with rest after division=0
\item divide 25 by 2 to get 12, with rest after division=1
\item divide 12 by 2 to get 06, with rest after division=0
\item divide 06 by 2 to get 03, with rest after division=0
\item divide 03 by 2 to get 01, with rest after division=1
\item divide 01 by 2 to get 00, with rest after division=1
\end{itemize}

If you now look at the rests after division from bottom to top, you get (1,1,0,0,1,0).
Remember from section \ref{sec:bin2dec} that one can add zeros to the left of any number without changing its value.
Since we prefer to work with binary numbers (keys) of length 7 (i.e. the number of symbols p,q,...,v) we turn the binary number
into key (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0).

\subsubsection{Tip about binary/decimal conversion}
Practically all operating systems nowadays have some built-in calculator application that knows how 
to convert between binary and decimal should you ever need to do so.

\section{What's the point? How do these binary numbers help us analyze music?}
Using this enumeration method, I listed all the 127 modes that are symmetrical around f\# as can 
be seen in section \ref{sec:plain}. I've sorted the modes by length. 
Each mode is annotated with a few numbers, e.g. 74:7-71. The number 74 means it's the 74th mode
in the list of modes sorted by length. The number 7 means that the mode consists of 7 notes, distributed
symmetrically around f\#. The number 71 is the decimal number that corresponds to the binary key (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,0,0,0,1,1,1)
that uniquely defines the mode:

\begin{lilypond}
\score { 
   \new Staff = "up" {

	 \accidentalStyle "forget"
      } 
   }
}
\end{lilypond}

\subsection{The symmetry of Messiaen's modes around f\#}
A first thing that struck me as interesting is that all of Messiaen's modes can be found back in the list of 127 modes enumerated in 
section \ref{sec:plain} (albeit not always in first transposition, which is caused by our restriction to only look at modes symmetrical around f\#, 
and not to look at modes symmetrical around -- say -- g.):
\begin{itemize}
\item Messiaen's mode 1 corresponds to our mode 85 (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,0,1,0,1,0,1)
      \begin{lilypond}
      \relative c' {
	\cadenzaOn c d e fis gis ais c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
      }
      \end{lilypond}

\item Messiaen's mode 2 corresponds to our mode 54 (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (0,1,1,0,1,1,0)
      \begin{lilypond}
      \relative c' {
	\cadenzaOn cis4 d e f g gis ais b \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
      }
      \end{lilypond}

\item Messiaen's mode 3 corresponds to our mode 93 (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,0,1,1,1,0,1)
      \begin{lilypond}
      \relative c' {
	\cadenzaOn c d dis e fis gis a ais c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
      }
      \end{lilypond}
      
\item Messiaen's mode 4 corresponds to our mode 103 (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,1,0,0,1,1,1)
      \begin{lilypond}
      \relative c' {
	\cadenzaOn c cis e f fis g ais b c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
      }
      \end{lilypond}

\item Messiaen's mode 5 corresponds to our mode 99 (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,1,0,0,0,1,1)
      \begin{lilypond}
      \relative c' {
	\cadenzaOn c cis f fis g b c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
      }
      \end{lilypond}
      
\item Messiaen's mode 6 corresponds to our mode 107 (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,1,0,1,0,1,1)
      \begin{lilypond}
      \relative c' {
	\cadenzaOn c cis dis f fis g a b c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
      }
      \end{lilypond}
      
\item Messiaen's mode 7 corresponds to our mode 119 (p,q,r,s,t,u,v) = (1,1,1,0,1,1,1)
      \begin{lilypond}
      \relative c' {
	\cadenzaOn c cis d e f fis g gis ais b c \cadenzaOff \bar"|."
      }
      \end{lilypond}
      
\end{itemize}

\subsection{More symmetry in Messiaen's modes}
Now take a close look at the binary keys for Messiaen's modes. \emph{In all but one of his modes, the binary keys are 
themselves palindromes}, indicating that not only are the modes symmetrical around f\#, but they also have
extra internal symmetry around d\# (left-hand side of f\#) and around a (right-hand side of f\#). Having a palindromic
key thus implies that there's a second level of symmetrical interval distribution inside the upper and lower halves of the modes.

It would not be correct to say that only modes with palindromic binary keys sound good. Look e.g. at mode of internal symmetry 
number 90 (1,0,1,1,0,1,0), which is better known as "c dorian". The binary key is not palindromic but it does show 
other extra symmetries in its structure (observe how its binary key becomes a palindrome if you leave out the last 0).
Similarly, Messiaen's fourth mode of limited transposition also becomes a palindrome if you leave out the last 1 in its binary key,
indicating that it has significant internal symmetries beyond the always present symmetry around f\#.

I'd like to speculate here that additional internal symmetries play an important role in making modes (and their "modes") sound good.
The human brain is optimized for pattern matching. It is sensitive to symmetries and the listener probably
subconsciously picks up the patterns and hears the symmetries present in the intervals that make up the mode.
(If that were true, we might even nominate the "Dorian" mode as the most natural of modes based on a diatonic scale.)
Modes with extra internal symmetries look like good candidates for harmony and melody experiments.

\subsection{Are there any modes with similar internal symmetries that are not Messiaen modes?}
\subsubsection{Perfect internal symmetry}
In section \ref{sec:palindrome} all modes are listed that have palindromic binary keys. Note 
that almost all of Messiaen's modes appear here in one form or another, and that some 
modes appear that are not part of Messiaen's musical language. This is because we used
\emph{internal symmetry} instead of \emph{limited transposition} as criterion. From these results,
it's quite clear that there's a close connection between the two criteria. It's also interesting that 
a number of (shorter) modes appear which, to the best of my knowledge, were not used directly by Messiaen, but
which may be interesting for further harmonic and melodic experiments.

In what follows, remember that the notation "mode x-y" means "a mode with x notes and key y, where y should be converted to binary to see
which notes are present in the mode. Compare the descriptions given here to the modes as listed in section \ref{sec:palindrome}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Mode 02-008 (0,0,0,1,0,0,0) is a ditonic mode. Two notes may be a bit limited for a composition. Interesting though that it is (enharmonically equivalent to) a tritone, which is one of the basic building blocks for Messiaen's musical language.
\item Mode 04-020 (0,0,1,0,1,0,0) is a tetratonic mode. 
\item Mode 06-028 (0,0,1,1,1,0,0) is a hexatonic mode. 
\item Mode 04-034 (0,1,0,0,0,1,0) is a tetratonic mode. Interesting about this mode is that there's even more symmetry present in the lower and upper half of the binary key. This is a third level of symmetry in the mode.
\item Mode 06-042 (0,1,0,1,0,1,0) is a hexatonic mode.  Interesting about this mode is that there's even more symmetry present in the lower and upper half of the binary key. This is a third level of symmetry in the mode.
\item Mode 08-054 (0,1,1,0,1,1,0) is an octotonic mode. It's also known as Messiaen's second mode of limited transposition.
\item Mode 10-062 (0,1,1,1,1,1,0) is a decatonic mode. This mode is not listed by Messiaen. However, if we extend this mode with a c\# at the right, we get a "mode" of Messiaen's seventh mode of limited transposition built on note d.
\item Mode 03-065 (1,0,0,0,0,0,1) is a tritonic mode. It consists of 2 tritones.
\item Mode 05-073 (1,0,0,1,0,0,1) is a pentatonic mode. 
\item Mode 07-085 (1,0,1,0,1,0,1) is a heptatonic mode. It's also known as Messiaen's first mode of limited transposition, or as the whole-tone scale. Interesting about this mode is that there's even more symmetry present in the lower and upper half of the binary key. This is a third level of symmetry in the mode.
\item Mode 09-093 (1,0,1,1,1,0,1) is a nonatonic mode. This is Messiaen's third mode of limited transposition. Interesting about this mode is that there's even more symmetry present in the lower and upper half of the binary key. This is a third level of symmetry in the mode.
\item Mode 07-099 (1,1,0,0,0,1,1) is a heptatonic mode. This is Messiaen's fifth mode of limited transposition.
\item Mode 09-107 (1,1,0,1,0,1,1) is a nonatonic mode. This is a "mode" of Messiaen's sixth mode of limited transposition built on note c\#.
\item Mode 11-119 (1,1,1,0,1,1,1) is an undecatonic mode. This is a "mode" of Messiaen's seventh mode of limited transposition built on note b. Interesting about this mode is that there's even more symmetry present in the lower and upper half of the binary key. This is a third level of symmetry in the mode.
\item Mode 13-127 (1,1,1,1,1,1,1) is the chromatic scale itself. This mode also has a third and even fourth level of symmetry. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Partial internal symmetry}
Now follows a list of modes that are partially palindromic as follows: the binary keys of the modes listed here become palindromic 
if you leave out either the first or last bit. They are listed in musical form in section \ref{sec:partialpalindrome}.
These form another subset of modes (slightly less "perfect" than the modes in the previous section).
Probably some of these modes are better known under other names, but my knowledge of existing scales is not
large enough to recognize all of them.

By reducing the constraints on symmetry also other interesting modes can be selected (e.g. modes that are a palindromic if you leave
out 2 outer bits), but listing those is left as an exercise to the interested reader.

\begin{itemize}
\item  001  ( 0,0,0,0,0,0,1 ) is a mode consisting of a single note f\#. This is a bit limited to compose with :)
\item  012  ( 0,0,0,1,1,0,0 ) tetratonic
\item  018  ( 0,0,1,0,0,1,0 ) tetratonic
\item  024  ( 0,0,1,1,0,0,0 ) tetratonic
\item  025  ( 0,0,1,1,0,0,1 ) tetratonic. Sounds quite exotic (arabic?).
\item  030  ( 0,0,1,1,1,1,0 ) octatonic
\item  033  ( 0,1,0,0,0,0,1 ) tritonic
\item  036  ( 0,1,0,0,1,0,0 ) tetratonic
\item  037  ( 0,1,0,0,1,0,1 ) pentatonic
\item  045  ( 0,1,0,1,1,0,1 ) heptatonic. This is c\# aeolian mode (natural minor diatonic scale).
\item  051  ( 0,1,1,0,0,1,1 ) heptatonic. Sounds quite exotic (arabic?)
\item  060  ( 0,1,1,1,1,0,0 ) octatonic
\item  061  ( 0,1,1,1,1,0,1 ) nonatonic
\item  063  ( 0,1,1,1,1,1,1 ) undecatonic. Like a chromatic scale but without note c.
\item  064  ( 1,0,0,0,0,0,0 ) ditonic. Consists of only notes c.
\item  066  ( 1,0,0,0,0,1,0 ) tetratonic. Consists of the notes of a sus4 chord built on c.
\item  067  ( 1,0,0,0,0,1,1 ) pentatonic.
\item  076  ( 1,0,0,1,1,0,0 ) hexatonic.
\item  082  ( 1,0,1,0,0,1,0 ) hexatonic.
\item  090  ( 1,0,1,1,0,1,0 ) octatonic. This is really just the dorian mode of c.
\item  091  ( 1,0,1,1,0,1,1 ) nonatonic. Like the dorian mode of c but with f\# added.
\item  094  ( 1,0,1,1,1,1,0 ) decatonic.
\item  097  ( 1,1,0,0,0,0,1 ) pentatonic.
\item  102  ( 1,1,0,0,1,1,0 ) octatonic. Sounds quite exotic (arabic?).
\item  103  ( 1,1,0,0,1,1,1 ) is the fourth mode of limited transposition of Messiaen.
\item  109  ( 1,1,0,1,1,0,1 ) nonatonic. Left halve sounds darker than right halve.
\item  115  ( 1,1,1,0,0,1,1 ) nonatonic.
\item  126  ( 1,1,1,1,1,1,0 ) dodecatonic. Like a chromatic scale, but with f\# left out.
\item  127  ( 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 ) is the chromatic scale. This is the only key that also appears in the fully palindromic modes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Deriving harmonies from modes of internal symmetry}
Another question I was struggling with was why Messiaen chose to build chords based on the interval of a fourth.
During my investigation I think I saw a possible explanation as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sections \ref{sec:second}, \ref{sec:third}, \ref{sec:fourth}, \ref{sec:fifth} systematically list the chords
built on the modes of internal symmetry by taking notes from consecutive mode (scale) degrees, every second mode degree,
every third mode degree, every fourth mode degree respectively.
\item As is clearly visible, the fewer notes are in a mode that is symmetrical around f\#, the more widely spaced those notes are (on average).
\item In wider spaced modes (many 0's in the binary key), it makes sense to build chords from mode degrees that are close enough to each other.
\item In more dense modes (many 1's in the binary key), it makes sense to build chords from mode degrees that are spaced further apart. If we use notes too close
together, every chord sounds very dissonant and there's not much room for creating harmonic contrasts.
\item Since Messiaen's modes are relatively dense compared to - say - a diatonic scale (Messiaen's modes all have 8 or more notes, whereas a diatonic scale has 7 notes), 
my guess is that the harmonies as built using every second mode degree sound a bit too harsh, and Messiaen therefore decided to to use 
every third mode degree (i.e. using fourths).
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
To summarize:
\begin{itemize}
\item First we systematically listed all modes with internal symmetry around f\# derived from a chromatic scale. We found that there are 127 such modes.
\item Then, we saw how all of Messiaen's modes are part of this list of 127 modes, meaning that they at least have some symmetry in interval distribution.
\item After that, we noticed how all but one of the Messiaen modes contain extra symmetries in the lower half and upper half of the mode (palindromic keys).
We listed all modes that have both symmetry around f\# and the extra symmetries in the lower half and upper half of the mode, and discovered some 
potentially interesting modes not directly used by Messiaen (with fewer notes). Even though we didn't care about the property of \emph{limited transposition}, by
just considering symmetry arguments we arrived at a very similar set of modes.
\item While doing so, we also formulated a possible explanation for why Messiaen may have chosen to build his chords using fourths,
and we speculated about how internal symmetry may make Messiaen's modes sound better than other, randomly chosen, modes.
\end{itemize}
